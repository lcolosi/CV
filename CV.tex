\textsc{2021-Present} &{\bf Graduate Student - Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO)}\\
& My research aims to better understand the underlying physics of the coupled air-sea system at the submesoscale and how interactions between surface waves, winds, and currents at these scales impact the larger climate system using theoretical and field studies. Advisors: Luc Lenain, Nicholas Pizzo, Laurent Grare.\\[5pt]
\end{tabular}
\\[10pt]
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
\textsc{2020} &{\bf Staff Research Associate 1 - Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory at SIO}\\
& My research aims to leverage measurements from Instrumented Liquid Robotic Wave Gliders to better constrain interactions between surface waves, winds, and currents. The focus is to develop methods to obtain higher accuracy measurements of directional surface waves down to short scales aboard these autonomous vehicles. Advisors: Luc Lenain, Nicholas Pizzo, Laurent Grare.\\[5pt]
